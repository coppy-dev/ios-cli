# Coppy Generator

Coppy generator is a companion tool for the Coppy SDK. Its purpose is to generate swift classes, that will be used by the Coppy SDK in the runtime.

It can be used in two ways:

- As part of the Coppy SDK swift package plugin that can be used if you are building your project with Xcode.
- As a standalone CLI tool, if you are using some other tool to build your project, or have issues using the Xcode plugin.
